# AI Model Specification

This document outlines the AI models used in the FireAI system and their specifications.

## Model Overview

FireAI uses Ollama to run local LLM models, providing AI assistance without requiring external API calls. This ensures:
- Privacy of sensitive emergency information
- Operation in limited connectivity environments
- Customization for emergency response scenarios

## Supported Models

The system is compatible with various models available through Ollama, including:
- Llama 2
- Mistral
- Vicuna
- GPT4All
- Other compatible models

## Model Selection Guidelines

For emergency response scenarios, we recommend:

| Deployment Type | Recommended Model | Min. System Req. |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Low Resource   | Llama 2 7B        | 8GB RAM          |
| Standard       | Mistral 7B        | 16GB RAM         |
| High Capacity  | Llama 2 13B       | 32GB RAM         |

## Prompt Templates

The system uses specialized prompt templates for emergency scenarios, including:

| Field ID | Prompt Template | Example Output |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| `personal_information.national_id` | "Create a question to ask for the victim's National ID or SSN." | "What is the victim's National ID or SSN? (Optional)" |
| `contact_information.phone_number` | "Create a question to ask for the victim's phone number." | "What is the victim's phone number?" |
| `disaster_information.disaster_type` | "Create a question to categorize the type of emergency/disaster." | "What type of disaster are you reporting?" |
| `disaster_information.fire_active` | "Create a yes/no question about active fire." | "Is the fire still active? (Yes/No)" |

## Model Integration

The models are integrated through the Ollama Flask API, which provides:
- REST API interface for the backend
- Model loading and management
- Response generation based on user queries
- Context management for conversations

# Security and Privacy Measures

This document outlines the security and privacy measures implemented in the FireAI system.

## Data Protection

### Personal Information
- All personal information is encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Transmission of PII occurs only over HTTPS
- Access to personal information is restricted and logged
- Data minimization principles applied to emergency reporting

### Database Security
- MongoDB authentication enabled
- Network access restricted to application servers
- Regular security patching and updates
- Regular backups with encrypted storage

## Authentication and Authorization

### User Authentication
- JWT-based authentication system
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Multi-factor authentication option for administrative users
- Session timeout and automatic logout functions

### Role-Based Access Control
- Four distinct user roles with appropriate permissions:
  - Victim: Limited to own emergency data
  - Citizen: Public information only
  - Responder: Emergency data within assigned region
  - Helper: Limited emergency data based on assignment

## Network Security

### API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration to restrict unauthorized origins
- Input validation on all endpoints
- JWT validation for protected routes

### Infrastructure Security
