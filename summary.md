# FireAI Project - Summary of Changes and Setup

## Codebase Analysis
I performed a comprehensive analysis of the FireAI codebase, which revealed:

- **Project Structure**: The project consists of a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB for data storage
- **Frontend**: Built with React 19.0.0, featuring a role-based interface (Victim, Citizens, Responders, Helpers)
- **Backend**: Simple Express server with MongoDB connection using Mongoose
- **Development Status**: Early development stage with basic UI components and server setup

## Changes Made

1. **Updated README.md**
   - Updated the project description to accurately reflect the current state
   - Fixed the project structure section to match the actual codebase
   - Added detailed setup instructions for both frontend and backend
   - Included information about technologies used and features in development

2. **Fixed Backend Configuration**
   - Corrected the dotenv configuration in config.js to properly read environment variables
   - Created proper environment files for development

3. **MongoDB Setup**
   - Set up and started MongoDB service for local development
   - Configured the backend to connect to the local MongoDB instance

4. **Port Configuration**
   - Configured the backend to run on port 3000
   - Set up the frontend to run on port 3001 to avoid conflicts

## Setup Process

1. **Backend Setup**
   - Installed backend dependencies with npm install
   - Created proper environment configuration
   - Started MongoDB service
   - Launched the Express server on port 3000

2. **Frontend Setup**
   - Installed frontend dependencies with npm install
   - Configured to run on port 3001
   - Started the React development server

## Current State
- Both backend and frontend are successfully running locally
- Backend is connected to MongoDB
- Frontend is accessible at http://localhost:3001
- Basic navigation between different user roles is functional

## Next Steps
- Implement features from the todoList:
  - User identity management
  - Emergency tracking
  - LLM integration
  - Central server communication
- Add proper API routes in the backend
- Enhance the frontend with improved styling and user experience
